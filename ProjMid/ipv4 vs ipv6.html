						<h1 style="text-align: center">IPv4 vs IPv6: Understanding the Differences and Looking Ahead</h1>
					</header>
					<p>As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow exponentially, more devices connect online daily. There has been fear that, at some point, addresses would just run out. This conjecture is starting to come true.<br>

					Have no fear; the Internet is not coming to an end. There is a solution to the problem of diminishing IPv4 addresses. We will provide information on how more addresses can be created, and outline the main issues that need to be tackled to keep up with the growth of IoT by adopting IPv6.<br>

					We also examine how Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) vs. Internet Protocol 4 (IPv4) plays an important role in the Internet’s future and evolution, and how the newer version of the IP is superior to older IPv4.</p>
					
					<h3 style="color:black;text-align: center">How an IP Address Works</h3>
					<p>IP stands for “Internet Protocol,” referring to a set of rules which govern how data packets are transmitted across the Internet.<br><br>
					Information online or traffic flows across networks using unique addresses. Every device connected to the Internet or computer network gets a numerical label assigned to it, an IP address that is used to identify it as a destination for communication.<br><br>
					Your IP identifies your device on a particular network. It’s I.D. in a technical format for networks that combine IP with a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and enables virtual connections between a source and destination. Without a unique IP address, your device couldn’t attempt communication.</p>
					
					<p>IP addresses standardize the way different machines interact with each other. They trade data packets, which refer to encapsulated bits of data that play a crucial part in loading webpages, emails, instant messaging, and other applications which involve data transfer.<br><br>
					Several components allow traffic to flow across the Internet. At the point of origin, data is packaged into an envelope when the traffic starts. This process is referred to as a “datagram.” It is a packet of data and part of the Internet Protocol or IP.<br><br>
					A full network stack is required to transport data across the Internet. The IP is just one part of that stack. The stack can be broken down into four layers, with the Application component at the top and the Datalink at the bottom.</p>

					</div><br>
					
					<h4 style="color:black;text-align: center">Stack:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li style="font-weight: bold">Application – HTTP, FTP, POP3, SMTP</li>
						<li style="font-weight: bold">Transport – TCP, UDP</li>
						<li style="font-weight: bold">Networking – IP, ICMP</li>
						<li style="font-weight: bold">Datalink – Ethernet, ARP</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						As a user of the Internet, you’re probably quite familiar with the application layer. It’s one that you interact with daily. Anytime you want to visit a website; you type in http://[web address], which is the Application.<br><br>

						Are you using an email application? At some point then, you would have set up an email account in that application, and likely came across POP3 or SMTP during the configuration process. POP3 stands for Post Office Protocol 3 and is a standard method of receiving an email. It collects and retains email for you until picked up.<br><br>

						From the above stack, you can see that the IP is part of the networking layer. IPs came into existence back in 1982 as part of ARPANET. IPv1 through IPv3 were experimental versions. IPv4 is the first version of IP used publicly, the world over.

					<h4 style="color:black">How is IPv6 different?</h4>
					<p>
					Internet Protocol Version 6 or IPv6 is the newest version of Internet Protocol used for carrying data in packets from one source to a destination via various networks. IPv6 is considered as an enhanced version of the older IPv4 protocol, as it supports a significantly larger number of nodes than the latter.<br><br>

					IPv6 allows up to 2128 possible combinations of nodes or addresses. It is also referred to as the Internet Protocol Next Generation or IPng. It was first developed in the hexadecimal format, containing eight octets to provide more substantial scalability. Released on June 6, 2012, it was also designed to deal with address broadcasting without including broadcast addresses in any class, the same as its predecessor.

					<h4 style="color:black;text-align: center">Comparing Difference Between IPv4 and IPv6</h4>
					 We can summarize the differences between these two protocols in a table. Each has its deficits and benefits to offer.
